Going to work on reimplementing nursing home filtering
    (FIXED)BUG: Added territory and date filters, then went to add tag filter and was getting that I didn't have valid tags but I did
    BUG: Added tag, dae, territory filters but used default anyways
    Fixed this for territory, still have to test for tag and date

Going to work on reimplementing nursing home filtering
    (FIXED)BUG: Added territory and date filters, then went to add tag filter and was getting that I didn't have valid tags but I did
    BUG: Added tag, dae, territory filters but used default anyways
    Fixed this for territory, still have to test for tag and date

7/7/22
Start wih testing date filter, then nursing home tag filter
    Ran download, then date filter with nothing else. Passed
    Tag filter with nothing else. Took a long ass time. Aborted
    Tag filter with Date and Territory filter. Passed

Going to test current state of formatting Nursing Homes.
    Works, but seems to be out of whack. I lied. It works fine.

Want to work on getting the other types working next.


7/8/22
Going to start working on Home Health Data
    Refactored options so that each datasets options are saved in a dict in the controller
    Changed visual options for Home Health Data

Need to implement the dates for home health, as well as excel sheet creation 
implemented home health state statistics optional sheet, but only tested calling it on it's own, without nursing home sheets being made

GOing to implement long term care data first, then I'll come back and add options for home health and long term
Want to be able to have measure codes for lthc as a default optional sheet

Having problems with date filter for long term, returning empty dataframe. 

Ran test with everything activated (except last two for nursing homes), with a wide date range, taking very long
ValueError: 'MD' is not in list - probably duplicated changng territory names


7/9/22
Going to add a bool so that crucial steps aren't duplicated when calling all 3 make sheets, so that I can eventually allow for
only some of the data sets to be used

Made a default function for this
Tested doing all 3 make sheets with TESTING enabled, worked

Want to work on options for home health and finish them before coming back to long term care 

7/10/22
Trying to make options for home health without hardcoding, going to ask on stack over flow
Fixed that shit - go back and fix for nursing home next

7/11/22 
Fixed options for nursing and home health. Refactored the files. 
Back to working on home health options.
Now need to implement the exclusions.

Implemented exclusion options. Need to add option to exclude empty ownership types

7/17/22
Implemented empty ownership types and org averages for HHC. 
Now going to implement star picker for quality of care. quality_of_patient_care_star_rating

Finished Home Health. Last but not least: Long Term care.
Options:
    Don't include mobile
    ownership types
    ~~bed range~~
    ~~date range~

For ultimate formatting:
ldf.set_index(['provider_state', 'provider_name', 'provider_city', 'address_line_1','address_line_2', 'phone_number', 'ownership_type','total_number_of_beds', 'measure_code'])

Need to figure out what the codes mean and include it in the sheet. Possibly change the data around the measure code.
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/sites/default/files/data_dictionaries/long_term_care_hospital/LTCH-Data-Dictionary.pdf
Will see if pandas can turn into pdf.

For now going to just include the data dictionary. Turning the pdf into a dataframe seems infeasible in an automated fashion. Maybe
I'll just provide a link to the dataset page so they can always grab the most recent data dictionary. Maybe even a screen to download it.

7/18/22
Make a new branch!

Working on bed range for long term care, still need to add all terrs and data option to home health.
Also need to move main date range option into nursing homes.
Nevermind. Already implemented date range for long term and nursing homes.

7/19/22
Implemented all initial long term options, now testing.

Came across the fact that writing to csvs is MUCH quicker, at the cost of not being able to use set_index to group values.
Maybe there's another way to do that. Running time test now for Justin. 
Made Test_Territory_NursingHomes.xlsx: write to excel took 242 seconds for 41192 rows!!! Versus 2 seconds....
Validated mobile feature and exclude ownership_types, need to check for undefined

I will make a new branch where I keep old excel format, then change main to be csv
Should probably make it exclude x ownership type organizations

Merged branches. Made excel only branch. Next is all for home health and long term.

Refactoring utlities.py to be csv. Done.

Going to add all territories and and all states to home health and make folders for each type of sheets
